                        <p>Internship at Intelligent Agents and Synthetic Characters Group of Instituto Superior TeÃÅcnico, where I developed an agent to compete in the Geometry Friends annual competition. Geometry Friends is a two player cooperative computer game. It is a platform game in a 2D environment with simulated physics (with gravity and friction). The goal of the players is to gather a set of diamonds in the least amount of time. In this competition the agent of me and my colleague achieved first and third place in the circle and rectangle, respectively. As a follow-up to our good results we wrote a paper that was accepted and presented at the DiGRA-FDG Conference 2016 in Dundee, Scotland.</p>
                        <p>For this project the Tech Stack was: C# and Git.</p>
